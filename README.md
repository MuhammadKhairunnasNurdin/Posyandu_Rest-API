### **üïô Installation:**

---

1. Open Address repository: [Repository GitHub](https://github.com/MuhammadKhairunnasNurdin/Posyandu_Rest-API)

2. Fork repository:

    - Search Fork in right corner of repo and click
    - Click Create Fork in bottom, make sure you uncheck the Copy the master branch only
    - If in your repository had fork from above repository address, your fork process is success

3. Clone fork repository:
    - clone using HTTPS
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Your_Github_Username/Posyandu_Rest-API
    ```
    - clone using SSH
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Your_Github_Username/Posyandu_Rest-API
    ```

   note: change "Your_GitHub_Username" with your actual username, like: MuhammadKhairunnasNurdin

4. Enter path folder repository:

    ```bash
    cd Posyandu_Rest-API
    ```

5. Install dependency:

    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

6. Copy file `.env.example` to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

7. Generate key:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

8. Fill DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD in `.env` file with default password for User in application:

    ```bash
    DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```

   note: change "your_password" with your actual default password

9. If you use docker, don't do below step, go to [DOCKER SETUP(OPTIONAL)](#-docker-setupoptional) section

10. Create new Database `posyandu_rest_api` (or match the database name in the file `.env`) in phpmyadmin or terminal:

     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     create database posyandu_rest_api;
     exit;
     ```

11. Migrate and Seeding database:

     ```

12. run local server:

    - run Laravel Server:
     ```bash
     php artisan serve
     ```

13. Open browser and Access Endpoint in Localhost `http://localhost/api` (for Laravel Server) or `http://localhost/www/Posyandu_Rest-API/api` (for Laragon Server)

#### note: for steps 2-11 or any of steps that using bash or command syntax, you can do those bash syntax in your terminal or IDE-integrated terminal ####

### **üïô DOCKER SETUP(OPTIONAL):**

---

1. Change your .env:
    -  DB_HOST to `mysql`
    -  DB_PASSWORD to `password`
    -  You can change DB_USERNAME up to you
    -  If you encounter port issue, change port below that not used in your machine:
        1. Uncomment and change `APP_PORT` to value with prefix '8', like 81, 82, etc
        2. change `APP_URL` like `http://localhost:81` with '81' is your `APP_PORT` value
        3. Uncomment and change `FORWARD_DB_PORT` to value with prefix '330', like 3307, 3308, etc
        4. Uncomment and change `VITE_PORT` to value with prefix '517', like 5174, 5175, etc
        5. If your mailpit port is used, do this:
            1. change `FORWARD_MAILPIT_PORT` to value with prefix '102', like 1026, 1027, etc
            2. change `FORWARD_MAILPIT_DASHOARD_PORT` to value with prefix '802', like 8026, 8027, etc

2. Run container:
    ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
   ``` 
   you can create alias in your terminal for sail command:
    -  open bashrc file:
       ```bash
       nano ~/.bashrc
       ```
    -  add this line in the end of file:
       ```bash
       alias sail='sh $([ -f sail ] && echo sail || echo vendor/bin/sail)'
       ```
    -  click ctrl + x, then type y and enter
    -  you can do run container with alias like this:
       ```bash
       sail up -d
       ```
3. If you use linux, change permission for project file:
    -  open terminal and type:
       ```bash
        sail root-shell
       ```
    -  in root shell terminal, type:
       ```bash
       cd ..
       chown -R root:sail html
       chmod -R 775 html
       exit
       ```

4. Migrate and Seeding database:
    ```bash
    sail artisan migrate --seed
    ```
   all database related command like migrate, seed, etc. You can add 'sail artisan' prefix before that command

5. run npm dev:
    ```bash
    sail npm run dev
    ```
   all npm related command like install, run dev, etc. You can add 'sail npm' prefix before that command

6. Open browser and Access your Endpoint like `http://localhost/api` (for default url) or `http://localhost:81/api`, `http://localhost:82/api`, etc. (for APP_PORT changed)

7. After you finish your work and start your work again, use this commands:
    -  for stop container:
       ```bash
       sail down
       ```
    -  if you use `sail down` will stop and remove your container, this command will remove your database data, so use this command carefully
    -  for start container:
       ```bash
       sail start
       ```
    -  if you use `sail up -d` will start from scratch and will remove your database data, so use this command carefully

8. If you change your .env file, moreover port, you can do this command:
   ```bash
   sail down 
   sail up -d
   ```
   and do it again step 3 up to 7, this will refresh your container with new .env port

### **üïô Project Collaboration:**

---

1. Sync Your Fork repository:

   You can click in middle top right in Your GitHub repository: Posyandu_Rest-API

2. fetch change from your fork to local remote:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ``` 
   with this syntax, will update local remote to match updated fork
   if after this not show up which branch that updated, that mean your local remote is updated

3. if fetch is show updated branch:

   go to which branch that updated
   ```bash
   git switch frontend
   ```
   or
    ```bash
   git switch backend
   ```
   or
    ```bash
   git switch Other_Branch
   ```

   note: change "Other_Branch" with your branch that existed in origin remote

4. Pull code change in updated branch:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

5. Create your code change

6. Add to staging index your change:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

7. Commit change:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "commit message"
   ```

   Note: for conventional commit message you can follow this rule:
   #### Conventional Commit Messages
   See how a [minor change](#examples) to your commit message style can make a difference.

   **‚ÑπÔ∏è [git-conventional-commits](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits)**  A CLI util to ensure these conventions and generate changelogs

        style: remove empty line
        ```

8. Push change to fork related branch that your updated and don't push to master like 'git push origin master', or you blocked by rule (always check branch with steps 3, so push will hit remote branch that role rule targeted):

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

9. Do Pull Request from your fork to main repository to discuss the change with your team:
    - Open your fork in your repository, if in there has notification to compare and pull request hit that button in there
    - Create pull request from your fork to main repository related branch which your updated(like from frontend fork to frontend main repo)

10. (Optional) if when pull had problem with "merge using **ort** strategy", like merge commit with no actual changes make your work tree dirty, do this:
    ```bash
    git config pull.ff only
    ``` 
    Note: if there is error when pull, because git config pull.ff=only, do this:
     ```bash
     git config pull.rebase false
     ```

### **üóí Note :**

---

-   If there are update change in your fork, always synced that, because you cannot push and create pull request without that
-   When Checkout, Push or Pull, always check your git branch is related to your Role
-   Don't push to master with 'git push origin master' when add code change to GitHub
-   Always create Pull request like steps 9
-   if in Discord that connected with webhook had notify about pull request, you can join discussion and review your teams code
